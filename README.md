# a-star-pathfinding-visualizer


This project implements the A * search algorithm using python and visualizes it using the pygame module. 

The A*  algorithm is much more efficient than a standard algorithm like breadth-first search or depth-first search. 
It uses heuristics to find the smallest cost path from a starting node to the given end-node, by maintaining a tree of all the paths originating 
at the start node and extending those paths one edge at a time until its reaches it's goal node.
